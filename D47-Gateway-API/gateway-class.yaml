# GatewayClass (Choose Controller)
# check for the getway class name 
# > kubectl get gc
  # this above command shows the "controller name" as well as "class" name, in my case its "nginx" because we didn't created this GatewayClass.

# if getway class not exists create one by below code:
# apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
# kind: GatewayClass
# metadata:
#   name: my-gateway-class
# spec:
#   controllerName: example.com/gateway-controller
